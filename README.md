## Overview

In this Frontend Mentor project I have created an email validator, I have used HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## My process

I started creating the structure in HTML, the divs, classes etc...

So I gave it the shape I wanted with CSS, using different attributes and properties.

Finally, for the validator to work, I used javascript, creating a function that goes through a regular expression to know if the entered email is valid or not.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Font Awesome for social icons
